# Chess 240
#### *CS 240 TA Dallin's journey through the new CS 240 project*

I'm a new TA for CS 240, and they changed the course project since I took the class. So I need to go through the project and figure it out. Here in this README file I'll log problems I run into and how I solved them so I can better help students with the same problems.

### Project Set-Up
- Hard to figure out lol
- actually super easy lol
- The "client" "server" and "shared" folders need to be at the root of the IntelliJ Project
- Download the starter code, and copy it into a blank folder that you generated when you did '/git clone' to pull your empty starter GitHub project into your system

### Phase 0
- Just define the board first
-
