#### *CS 240 TA Dallin's journey through the new CS 240 project*

I'm a new TA for CS 240, and they changed the course project since I took the class. So I need to go through the project and figure it out. Here in this README file I'll log problems I run into and how I solved them so I can better help students with the same problems.

### Project Set-Up
- Hard to figure out lol!
