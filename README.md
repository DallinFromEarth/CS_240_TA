# Chess 240
#### *CS 240 TA Dallin's journey through the new CS 240 project*

I'm a new TA for CS 240, and they changed the course project since I took the class. So I need to go through the project and figure it out. Here in this README file I'll log problems I run into and how I solved them so I can better help students with the same problems.

### Project Set-Up
- Hard to figure out lol
- It seems having a "java" package wrapper in all the "src" folders makes the provided starter code not able to find the other starter code. I simply removed the wrapper "java" wrapper package. For example, changed "shared/main/java/chess" to "shared/main/chess"
- Don't forget to add Junit as a dependancy in the IntelliJ Project Structure. The id to look up in maven is "org.junit.jupiter"
- The easiest way I found to get stuff working was to just start with a blank new project and build out the structure from there
- The "main" folder in each section of the project should be marked as a source root

### Phase 0
- Just define the board first
-
